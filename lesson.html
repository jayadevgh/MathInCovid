        In 1635, the first school was finally open. However most children couldn’t afford or couldn’t make it to <br/>
        the school so their parents homeschooled them. We have made an app to support the difficult times a <br/>
        student has faced at home. It is very interactive and enjoyable from lessons to teach them and fun <br/>
        games to add a bit of fun to their studying. As their community builds more schools the app can <br/>
        still work as practice at any time. <br/>

        Now into more detail about when this happened. Colonial Virginia was politically controlled <br/>
        by wealthy landowners who relied on tutors and private schools to educate their children. <br/>
        It also depends on the social class of the family. The boys of upper class families were <br/>
        sent abroad to receive college or university graduation while lower class stayed at home <br/>
        and helped out in chores. Colonial people focused more on tasks like cleaning the farm and when <br/>
        they needed help the children did not go to school. Children usually go to school in the winter <br/>
        since there were fewer farm chores. They played many games including jump rope, tennis, hop <br/>
        scotch, hide and seek, and many more. Introducing kids' education at those times could <br/>
        potentially lead to innovations that help the hardworking people do their jobs easier. <br/>

        Math and english are useful in many situations such as speaking fluent english with people <br/>
        and handling taxing and food problems. The biggest problem about education was the poverty of <br/>
        the people. Most people lived in one room homes with dirt floors. Wealthy people dominated the <br/>
        community and benefited themselves instead of helping the community so they can increase their p <br/>
        rices on goods. Most people couldn’t travel far places and thought that home schooling was the  <br/>
        easier option. Now that you know all the information of the people living in the 1600’s, you check <br/>
        out our cool games, quizzes ,and lessons to become more knowledgeable. <br/>
